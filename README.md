# First-time / Post-package.json-update setup

After you obtain this repo's files for the first time, or whenever I update package.json, you'll need to run `npm install` in the repo's folder. You can get npm by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

# Building the extension's files

After setup, if you just want to build the files needed to try Deviant Love, run `npm run build`.

If you want to help develop Deviant Love, start `npm run watch` - it'll watch the [ES6 modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/) (.esm.js) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) templates (.svelte) that this project uses, and rebuild the appropriate files when they change.

If you'd like to tinker with the build process itself, check the [Rollup docs](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/) for info on rollup.config.js.

# Testing the built extension

With all the built files ready, use the WebExtension folder with the instructions for your browser:

* Firefox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox
	* (or use web-ext: https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/ )
* Chrome: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked
* Edge: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/extension-sideloading

Your browser may complain about parts of manifest.json it doesn't recognize. This won't cause problems.
