You will need Node.js installed.

In both this folder and the Release folder, run this command:
npm install

Then, in this folder, run this command:
npm run makeRelease

For stable releases, either the build-firefox directory or the "Deviant Love for Firefox [version].zip" file may be compared to the extension offered for download. For alphas/betas/RCs, only the latter will match exactly.

Some irrelevant files from the repo are omitted from this ZIP. For the full repo, see:
